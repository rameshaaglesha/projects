            <p className='text-white'>Hi! I'm a passionate MERN-STACK Developer with a strong focus on building responsive, <br /> user-friendly web interfaces using React.js and Tailwind CSS. I enjoy turning creative ideas into functional, <br /> efficient, and elegant web experiences.
                Currently, I'm expanding my skill set by diving into the MERN stack <br /> (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) to become a well-rounded Full-Stack Developer. <br /> Iâ€™m constantly learning, building, and looking for opportunities to grow in the world of modern web development.
